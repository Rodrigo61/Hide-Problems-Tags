This is a very simple extension for the Codeforces website. It allows you to Hide/Show problems' tags in an easier way (i.e. instead of changing your settings every time).

This extension just add some buttons to Hide/show the tags whenever you want.

**To use this extension, be sure that you DID select the option "Show tags for unsolved problems" in the settings of your account.**
