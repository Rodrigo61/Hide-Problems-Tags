This is a very simple extension for the codeforces website. It allows you to Hide/Show problems' tags in an easier way (i.e. instead of changing your settings every time).

This extensions just add some buttons to Hide/show the tags, as shown in screenshots below.

**To use this extension, be sure that you DID select the option "Show tags for unsolved problems" in the settings of your account.**

See the screenshots for more details and "Good Luck & high rating!"
